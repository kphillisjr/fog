// [Fog::EventPumpWin]
// ============================================================================

//! EventPumpWin implements a "traditional" Windows message pump. It contains
//! a nearly infinite loop that peeks out messages, and then dispatches them.
//! Intermixed with those peeks are callouts to DoWork for pending tasks,
//! DoDelayedWork for pending timers, and OnObjectSignaled for signaled objects.
//! When there are no events to be serviced, this pump goes into a wait state.
//! In most cases, this message pump handles all processing.
//!
//! However, when a task, or windows event, invokes on the stack a native dialog
//! box or such, that window typically provides a bare bones (native?) message
//! pump.  That bare-bones message pump generally supports little more than a
//! peek of the Windows message queue, followed by a dispatch of the peeked
//! message.  EventLoop extends that bare-bones message pump to also service
//! Tasks, at the cost of some complexity.
//!
//! The basic structure of the extension (refered to as a sub-pump) is that a
//! special message, kMsgHaveWork, is repeatedly injected into the Windows
//! Message queue.  Each time the kMsgHaveWork message is peeked, checks are
//! made for an extended set of events, including the availability of Tasks to
//! run.
//!
//! After running a task, the special message kMsgHaveWork is again posted to
//! the Windows Message queue, ensuring a future time slice for processing a
//! future event.  To prevent flooding the Windows Message queue, care is taken
//! to be sure that at most one kMsgHaveWork message is EVER pending in the
//! Window's Message queue.
//!
//! There are a few additional complexities in this system where, when there are
//! no Tasks to run, this otherwise infinite stream of messages which drives the
//! sub-pump is halted.  The pump is automatically re-started when Tasks are
//! queued.
//!
//! A second complexity is that the presence of this stream of posted tasks may
//! prevent a bare-bones message pump from ever peeking a WM_PAINT or WM_TIMER.
//! Such paint and timer events always give priority to a posted message, such as
//! kMsgHaveWork messages.  As a result, care is taken to do some peeking in
//! between the posting of each kMsgHaveWork message (i.e., after kMsgHaveWork
//! is peeked, and before a replacement kMsgHaveWork is posted).
//!
//! NOTE: Although it may seem odd that messages are used to start and stop this
//! flow (as opposed to signaling objects, etc.), it should be understood that
//! the native message pump will *only* respond to messages.  As a result, it is
//! an excellent choice.  It is also helpful that the starter messages that are
//! placed in the queue when new task arrive also awakens DoRunLoop.

  //! Dispatcher is used during a nested invocation of Run to dispatch events.
