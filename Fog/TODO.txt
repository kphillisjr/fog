[L] Low priority

TODO
====

[ ] Fog/Core:
    [ ] Remove allocPolicy and AllocPolicy enums, all detach functions must return err_t
        instead
    [ ] Fog::RegExp - use TRex
    [ ] Fog::String - not completed yet, add Locale support to group separators
    [ ] Fog::TextCodec - not completed yet
    [ ] StringUtil::some utf functions not completed yet
    [ ] Fog::BitArray - fix
    [ ] Temporary...<N>::free sometimes not frees the memory ?

[w] Fog/Xml
    [w] XMLDOM (with XMLDocument)
    [w] XMLParser
    [ ] XMLWriter

[ ] Fog/Svg
    [ ] SVGDOM (with SVGDocument)
    [ ] SVGParser (through XmlParser)
    [ ] SVGPainterEngine
    
[ ] Painter
    [ ] Text transform
    [ ] Text over path
    [ ] Patterns transform
    [ ] Text in path support
    [ ] Image scaling
    [ ] Image transform
    [ ] Introduce setClipPath() / restoreClip()
    [ ] Reduce using of malloc/free in painter. All painter allocations should be pooled to maximize
        performance. Something like zone objects (see AsmJit) can be introduced, because lifetime of
        painter created objects is very short.

[ ] Image
    [ ] Render text using Font::getGlyphs
    [ ] Add ColorLUT
        [ ] By color lut the contrast, brightness, threshold and gamma function can be implemented.
    [ ] Scaling
    [ ] Inverting alpha channel on PRGB32 images not implemented yet
    [ ] Image effects related
        [ ] Sharpen
        [ ] Gaussian Blur
        [ ] Convolve
    [ ] Draw/Blend/Composite another image  into image
        [ ] Here we can support more blending or raster based operations than in painter.
        [ ] Here we should support scaling
        [ ] Also same image into image operations (guaranted)
    [ ] Implement scroll().

[ ] Font
    [ ] Make caching work again
    [ ] Fix issue that this code """Font font; font.setSize(80);""" takes too long (3ms on my machine)
        due to incorrect cache control ?
    [ ] Ability to render to 'Path'
        [x] Win32
        [ ] Freetype2

[ ] Raster
    [ ] Remove templated functions in Raster_C.cpp. It's needed to specialize code for each operation
        and pixel format, because specialized functions for ARGB32 / PRGB32 formats can be sometimes
        smaller and faster (template based ones are large).
    [ ] Write C composite functions and remove templates
        [ ] Prgb dest
        [ ] Argb dest
    [ ] Write MMX composite functions
        [L] Prgb dest
        [L] Argb dest
    [ ] Write SSE2 composite functions
        [w] Prgb dest
        [ ] Argb dest
    [ ] Linear gradient can be calculated by SSE2, think about it! The instructions pmax pmin, pcmpgt
        can be used in increments
    [ ] Introduce compositing on RGB32/RGB24 images again. This shouldn't be hard, because many
        combinations will degrade into over/src/NOP. I like the idea that I can set CompositeAdd
        and make some effects in UI rendering.
    [ ] Introduce compositing on A8 images.
    [w] Introduce painting with constant alpha (addition to masks)

[ ] ColorMatrix
    [ ] Add possibility to use ColorMatrix in Painter::drawImage().

[ ] Path
    [ ] Port AGG code into Fog and remove dependencies to AntiGrain
    [ ] Add fitTo(RectF)
    [ ] Add addText(Font, String32) to path
    [ ] What about warp?

[ ] Fresh ideas
    [ ] Color effects (ColorMatrix, ColorLut, ...) should be grouped and result should be
        ColorEffect class that will be able to do any color based transformations. ColorEffect
        should be possible to set when blitting image by Fog::Painter.
    [ ] Image effects (Blur, Sharpen, ...) should be grouped and result should be
        ImageEffect class that will be able to do any image based transformations.
    [ ] Each effect should contain opacity value that will define blend factor of modified image
        into source image (this can be used by UI animations).

[ ] Optimizations
    [ ] ColorMatrix specializations (in Raster)
    [ ] Path SSE2 curve code
    [ ] Path SSE2 matrix transformations
