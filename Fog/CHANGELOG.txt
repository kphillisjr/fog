- Added image transform to Painter.
- Fixed image transform (matrix inversion).
- Added possibility to set matrix multiply order to - Pattern, Painter, Matrix.
- Renamed some methods related to image drawing - blitImage instead of drawImage, ...
- RasterPaintEngine now contains theoretically correct raster management, the buggy
  code that could set raster to invalid memory location is gone, instead there is now
  quite evil matrix manipulation to make meta and user origin fast.
- Added some new Region methods to do more (intersectAndClip and translateAndClip),
  these methods are used mainly by RasterPaintEngine
