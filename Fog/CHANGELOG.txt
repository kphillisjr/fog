- Added Path::addPath(const Path& path, const PointD& pt).
- Improved SSE2 vertex transform code.
- Added LINE_CAP_TRIANGLE, LINE_CAP_ROUND_REVERT, LINE_CAP_TRIANGLE_REVERT caps.
- Added startCap and endCap support in path stroking (stroker and painter related).
- Renamed missing methods from drawImage() to blitImage().

- Fixed wrong assertion in RasterPaintEngine.

2010-01-05
- Renamed PainterUtil to PaintUtil.
- Fixed matrix.scale() in PainterEngine, Pattern and Matrix (this
  function now accepts the order parameter).
- Added small scanline generator optimization.

2010-01-04
- Renamed PainterEngine to PaintEngine.
- Fixed RasterPaintEngine clipping again.

2010-01-03
- Added image transform to Painter.
- Fixed image transform (matrix inversion).
- Added possibility to set matrix multiply order to - Pattern, Painter, Matrix.
- Renamed some methods related to image drawing - blitImage instead of drawImage, ...
- RasterPaintEngine now contains theoretically correct raster management, the buggy
  code that could set raster to invalid memory location is gone, instead there is now
  quite evil matrix manipulation to make meta and user origin fast.
- Added some new Region methods to do more (intersectAndClip and translateAndClip),
  these methods are used mainly by RasterPaintEngine.
- Fixed image transform in SvgDom.
- Fixed bugs related to matrix transforms in raster paint engine.
